## Issue
Sometimes, the app's window occupies a larger area and can get in the way when you click on things. Closing and re-launching the app should fix it.

## Development and Building
- Clone this repository
- Create a virtual environment (optional)
- Install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `build.sh` or run the script's command manually
